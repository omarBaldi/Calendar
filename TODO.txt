Functionality of calendar

- As soon as the user open the application, I want to first retrieve 
today's day in order to know which month, year and day we are.
Based on the those I an calculate how many days does the month have and 
build small atom components containing the number.


The calendar will also have a select-box where the user is given the 
possibility to choose the month as well as the year.
NOTE: not possible to choose a month over the current one as well as for the year.
